# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about ...

* My Coding Learning Journey
* Career Objective
* My Skills
* My Education
* The challenges to starting a second career

### _I am a highly ambitious full stack web developer with a background in music education and web design. Expertise in Html5, css, Javascript,  Jquery, Python and Bootstrap.  Beginning knowledge and application of MySql and PHP. Currently studying web development while finishing up teaching career in music education._

#### _I have a Master's Degree in Education but am starting the journey to a second career in Coding. I have taken 4-6 courses on Coursera and really liked the platform and the teachers.

#### University of Michigan 
- Advanced Responsive Web Design 
- Interactivity with Javascript Javascript
- JQuery and JSON
- Building Web Applications in PHP
